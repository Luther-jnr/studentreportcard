This Java program collects school information and student performance data using the Scanner class. It stores the records of 12 students in arrays, including their names and marks for six subjects. Using loops and control statements, the program calculates each student’s total marks, assigns a grade based on the defined grading scale, and computes class statistics such as subject totals, averages, and grade counts. Finally, it prints a well-formatted performance report that matches the required layout.
